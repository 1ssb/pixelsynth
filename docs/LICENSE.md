3. Term; Termination. The term of this Agreement and the license granted herein continues until this

any portion of the Matterport Dataset or any Matterport Dataset Derived Information to the extent
contained in material that You published prior to the date of termination of this Agreement. You may
terminate this Agreement at any time by discontinuing use of, and deleting all copies of, the Matterport
Dataset and any Matterport Dataset Derived Information. This Agreement terminates automatically if
You fail to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement. Upon any termination of this Agreement,
You must cease use of the Matterport Dataset and any Matterport Dataset Derived Information and
destroy all copies of the foregoing; provided, however, that nothing herein will obligate You to delete or
remove any portion of the Matterport Dataset or any Matterport Dataset Derived Information from any
material that You published prior to the date of termination of this Agreement that did not violate the
terms of the Agreement. Sections 2.3, 2.4(a), and 4 through 10 shall survive any expiration or
termination of this Agreement.
4. Disclaimer. THE MATTERPORT DATASET IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” MATTERPORT MAKES NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS,
ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING
THE FOREGOING, MATTERPORT MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE MATTERPORT
DATASET WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM INTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FAILURES

OR THAT THE MATTERPORT DATASET WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. Some
jurisdictions do not allow some of the foregoing exclusions or limitations, so some of these exclusions
or limitations may not apply to You.
5. Indemnification. Matterport shall not be obligated to indemnify, defend or hold You harmless with
respect to any third-party claims arising out or relating to the Matterport Dataset, including without
limitation any claims for intellectual property infringement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
an admission that any such claims may arise. You, at Your own expense, will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Matterport, its corporate affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents (each a “Matterport Indemnitee”) from and against any claim, demand,
action, class action, investigation or other proceeding, including but not limited to all damages, losses,
liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising therefrom (each
a “Claim”), brought by any third party against a Matterport Indemnitee to the extent that such Claim is
based on, or arises out of: (a) a breach, or potential breach, of any of Your obligations under this
Agreement; (b) Your use of the Matterport Dataset, including Your use of any Matterport Dataset
Derived Data that You may create; or (c) any alleged or actual fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of You or Your subcontractors or agents. In the event of a claim in respect of which a
Matterport Indemnitee seeks indemnification from You under this Section 5, the Matterport Indemnitee
will promptly notify You in writing of the claim, cooperate with You in defending or settling the claim
at Your expense, and allow You to control the defense and settlement of the claim, including the
selection of attorneys; provided, however, that You shall not settle any claim unless such settlement
completely and forever releases the Matterport Indemnitee from all liability with respect to such claim
or unless the Matterport Indemnitee consents to such settlement in writing.
6. Limitation of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) IN NO EVENT
WILL MATTERPORT, ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE, UNDER ANY
CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY
FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; AND (b) IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF
MATTERPORT, ITS AFFILIATES OR ITS LICENSORS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED
$50. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. You acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
limitations of liability are essential elements of the bargain and that in the absence of such limitations,
the financial and other terms of this Agreement would be substantially different. Some jurisdictions do
not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so these limitations may
not apply to You.
7. Notice to United States Government End Users. If You are the U.S. Government or if You are a
contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) of the U.S. Government and are licensing the Matterport Dataset
for use by the U.S. Government or in connection with any contract or other transaction with the U.S.
Government, You acknowledge that by installing and using the Matterport Dataset, the Matterport
Dataset qualifies as commercial computer software and that any associated documentation qualifies as
commercial computer software documentation within the meaning of the applicable acquisition
regulations. The terms and conditions of this Agreement are fully applicable to the Government’s use
and disclosure of the Matterport Dataset and associated documentation, and shall supersede any
conflicting terms or conditions.

8. Compliance with Law. You represent and warrant that: (a) You are not located in a country that is
subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a
“terrorist supporting” country; and (b) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
restricted parties. You may not export, re-export, import, or transfer the Matterport Dataset in violation
of any applicable export laws or regulations, and You may not assist or facilitate others in doing any of
the foregoing. You acknowledge that it is Your responsibility to comply with any and all applicable
export and import laws.
9. Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the state of
California without reference to its conflict of law provisions. Any litigation, suit or other proceeding
regarding the rights or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be conducted exclusively before the
state and federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and the parties specifically consent to
Santa Clara County, California, as the exclusive venue for any such proceeding. This Agreement shall
not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the
application of which is expressly excluded.
10. Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the
remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. A waiver of any default is not a
waiver of any subsequent default. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights
hereunder without Matterport’s prior written consent, and any such attempt is void. This Agreement is
binding upon and is for the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The
parties acknowledge and agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely affecting Matterport’s
proprietary rights would cause irreparable harm to Matterport for which a remedy at law would be
inadequate and that Matterport shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any remedies it may
have hereunder or at law. This Agreement is the complete agreement between Matterport and You
concerning Your use of the Matterport Dataset, and supersedes any and all prior agreements and
representations between Matterport and You related to the same subject matter. Unless otherwise
specified herein, all notices and other communications required or permitted to be given or made
hereunder shall be in writing and: (a) if to Matterport, delivered personally or sent by pre-paid, first
class certified or registered mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier, to Matterport, Inc.,
352 E. Java Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, Attn: Legal Notices; or (b) if to You, by email or by pre-paid,
first class certified or registered mail, return receipt requested or by overnight courier to Your mailing
address. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in
accordance with preliminary paragraphs hereof or set forth in a writing signed by a representative of
Matterport and You, and then only to the extent specifically set forth therein.
